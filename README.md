# burnardCentral

This is the home of my ancestral database, currently maintained using gramps.
The file data.gramps contains the most recent update, in Gramps XML export format. The folder media contains copies of photos referenced by the data. 

To update: open the data.gramps file using a recent version of gramps and wait for it to rebuild.
To publish after an update:
 - export the data from gramps, overwriting the data.gramps file here, and check that into this repository
 - regenerate the HTML version as a tar.gz file and copy that up to lou@linux.ox.ac.uk:public_html/burnardCentral 
 - unpack it
